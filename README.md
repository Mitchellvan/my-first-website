# My Very First Web Page

Welcome!

This is my very first web page I'm creating using the tools and knowledge provived by CodeInstitute. 

On this site we have used HTML, GIT and GITHUB so far and I'm looking forward to exploring more in the modules to come. 

### My goals
* Build the base knowledge for Web Developement
* Gain a better understanding of what languages are used where
* Focus my skills to accomplish the most in a specific field
* Begin a career in Coding within the next 8 months



This page is just to set a broad explanation of what is being done and a little to better understand me. 


##### Onwards and upwards!!!
